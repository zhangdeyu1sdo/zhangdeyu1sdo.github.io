user_description: I'm a nomad Software Engineer, always searching for the next challenge; no task is too scary nor too difficult. Lately I have been immersed in the <b>crypto-world</b> working for Radix, a London based startup trying to create the next massive scalable DLT.. I'm one of the two guys behind all the JS related stuff. Visit my blog here":" <a href="https://mauriciourraco.com" target="_blank">https://mauriciourraco.com</a>
